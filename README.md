# TeamHub
Where collaboration blooms, <br>
In harmony, we break down rooms, <br>
Login, share, and create with glee, <br>
Join hands as one, united and free! <br>
A platform where developers can create a team while participating in a hackathon, here they can experience the ease of sharing common resources to the team and divide the work amongst themselves while tracking their progress.
## Inspiration:
The inspiration for TeamHub came from my personal desire to revolutionize collaboration and team management. I noticed the challenges faced by individuals and teams while trying to coordinate tasks, share files, and work together efficiently. My aim was to create a seamless platform that fosters collaboration, boosts productivity, and enhances the overall teamwork experience. It is from my personal experiences that I felt the need for such a platform.

## What it does:
- User Authentication: TeamHub allows users to log in, and if they are new to the platform, they can easily register to create an account.

- Team Creation and Joining: Users can create teams and generate unique team codes. Other team members can join the same team using this code, ensuring a seamless and secure onboarding process.

- Team Dashboard: Upon joining a team, all team members are redirected to a shared team dashboard. This centralized hub becomes the collaborative space for the team.

- Task Management: Within the team dashboard, I can assign tasks to team members. I can set due dates, establish task priorities, and update task statuses. This feature facilitates effective project tracking and helps team members understand their individual contributions.

- File Sharing: Team members can share relevant project materials, such as Figma files, Canva designs, APIs, and code snippets. This centralized repository ensures that all team members have access to the necessary resources.

## How we built it
For the development of TeamHub, I built everything from scratch, ensuring a personalized and tailored approach to the project. The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. On the backend, I utilized Node.js and Express to establish routes for login, registration, and team dashboard functionalities. All user and team data is stored in a MongoDB database, with the help of the Mongoose library for seamless integration.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing the backend, particularly for someone less experienced like me, was a significant challenge. However, I persevered and managed to create the necessary components from scratch. In particular, querying the MongoDB database proved challenging, but I overcame these obstacles with dedication and learning.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a full-stack project single-handedly gave me an immense sense of achievement and motivation to continue progressing. Through this project, I honed my skills, particularly in backend development, connecting to and querying MongoDB, and transferring data between the server and the webpage.

## What we learned
Throughout the development of TeamHub, I acquired valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in various aspects of web development. I deepened my understanding of backend technologies, data storage, and retrieval using MongoDB and Mongoose. The project also provided valuable insights into user authentication, frontend design, and creating a seamless user experience.

## What's next for TeamHub
In the future, I envision expanding TeamHub's features and refining the existing ones based on user feedback. I plan to add more advanced collaboration tools, such as real-time chat and notifications, to foster even more efficient teamwork. Additionally, I aim to enhance the overall performance and scalability of the platform to accommodate a growing user base. Continuously updating and improving TeamHub will ensure that it remains a valuable tool for teams striving to achieve excellence in their collaborative endeavors.
